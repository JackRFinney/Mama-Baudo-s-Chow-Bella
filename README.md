This website was created for Mama Baudo's Chow Bella in Jackson, TN. Mama Baudo's Chow Bella is a modern, casual style Italian restaurant in Thomsen Farms. It opened in 2019 and is owned and operated by Jack Baudo. The recipes have the same taste as the original Baudo's but with a more contemporary feel. Most everything is made from scratch and all of it with love. If you're looking for a good meal, don't hesitate to drop by and eat food cooked by one of the coders of this website.

We learned all the coding required for the webiste in one semester. Building the structure of the website was fairly simple. However, whenever we dove deeper into the styling and responsiveness, small issues occured. Whether it took a couple of minutes, or a couple of hours, we resolved the issues with the intent of making the website look good as well as function properly. We worked well together and helped create a website that improved upon the original Mama Baudo's website. We gave the website a cleaner and simpler look as well as making it more accessible for a potential customer to find whatever they need to look for. 

Our Website Includes:
• Pages that divide the menu into their proper categories. An easy-to-read as well as find menu is on our website. The original website included all the menu items in clumps which was very hard to navigate.
• Images from many of our items and what they look like because people eat with their eyes before anything else.
• Multiple links help connect the user to Mama Baudo's. You can access the Mama Baudo's Instagram, Facebook, Email, and the availability to contact the store and show its location.
• The color scheme of the website plays off of the colors of the restaurant's logo
• History of the Baudos' restaurants are displayed in an eye catching fashion which give an inside look into the family as well as the restaurant through the 50+ years they've been  operating.
• The option to submit a review from the website is fully functioning, and other reviews are displayed from past experiences.
• A favicon is shown to make sure you know you're visiting the right site.11th
